# PHAISTOS
PHAISTOS is a generalized data exchange framework and validation tool.

With PHAISTOS you can create validation models (schemas) for any kind/type of information structured in JSON and then share/exchange any data using the predefined model. Once shared or received, both sides (providers & consumers), can validate the data and make sure they are aligned to the original schema as agreed.
This is rather useful and comes handy when you have large data platforms that act as brokers and/or aggregators because it assists in decomplexing internal data operations before reaching the final storage area or the DB.

PHAISTOS is also a good utility that can be used in parallel with [FIWARE](https://www.fiware.org/).

The core and libraries of PHAISTOS are part of the [micro-MVC](https://github.com/g0d/micro-MVC) framework.
